# PoopSweeper 

A little browser game that I made to play with the Angular Framework while I was studing it. 

It is like minesweeper, but I am a pacifist, so... poops instead of bombs.

## Gameplay and Commands
The objective of the game is the same of the original minesweeper: clearing the board avoiding the poops. 

When you click on a cell, the cell will be uncovered revealing either a poop or the number of poops adjacent to it.

- **Left click**: clear cell
- **Right click**: flag cell to prevent clicking by mistake

Important note: in the original game the first click will never be a mine. But with poops, we can take the risk.
