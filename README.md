# :poop: PoopSweeper

PoopSweeper is a playful twist on the classic game of Minesweeper, built with the Angular framework. As a nod to pacifism, the usual mines are replaced with cartoonish poop emojis. 

This project was created as a part of my learning journey with Angular.

Live Demo: [https://michelefenu.github.io/poopsweeper/](https://michelefenu.github.io/poopsweeper/)

### Gameplay and Commands
In PoopSweeper, the goal remains similar to traditional Minesweeper: clear the board without triggering any poops. Each uncovered cell will either display a poop or the number of adjacent poops, aiding in safe navigation. 

- **Left click**: uncover a cell
- **Right click**: place a flag on a cell to mark a suspected poop, preventing accidental uncovering.

#### Note
Unlike the traditional Minesweeper, PoopSweeper starts with a bit of a twist â€” your first click might just uncover a poop! This adds an extra layer of challenge right from the start.

To set up PoopSweeper locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
